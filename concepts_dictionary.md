# My 1st Github project

What is a Git repository? It is where you can store your project and make modifications, all the versions will be stored there. Also, single collection of documents where you want to track modifications. It can be online or offline. 

What is Github? It is a collection of all your Git repositories. It is online.

### Conceptual areas

1. Developing area: the folder where you initialized git and where the project is developed. It is in your computer locally.

2. Staging area: where you are going to get what you want to make a snapshot of. While it is in this area, you can still make changes, it is an intermediate area. Location to prepare new snapshots to the timeline. To get there, git add goes from the developing area to the staging area. From the developing area to the local repository, this also happens locally. `git add` to send things to the staging area.

3. Local repository: where you save your snapshots. The `.git` is your local repository, it is a hidden folder. If you delete the file, you delete your local repository. You can use `ls -la` to visualize your `.git` folder. It is also in my computer - locally. 
   
   P.s: you can do `git status `to check the location of the files
